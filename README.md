# ðŸ“Š FCST Sync Tool â€“ Replace, Remove & Add Rows

This is a **Streamlit-based FCST Sync Tool** that helps you synchronize forecast (FCST) data between two files:

âœ… **Replace FCST** in the Base file (File1) when `LOC + ITEM + CHANNEL + FDATE` matches the Source file (File2).  
âœ… **Remove rows** from Base that no longer exist in Source.  
âœ… **Add new rows** from Source that are missing in Base.  
âœ… **Preserves leading zeros and formatting**.  
âœ… Generates a clean, **pipe-delimited CSV** ready for upload.

- Match rows using a unique key: `LOC + ITEM + CHANNEL + FDATE`
