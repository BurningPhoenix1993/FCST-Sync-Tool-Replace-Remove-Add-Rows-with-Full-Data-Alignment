# FCST-Sync-Tool-Replace-Remove-Add-Rows-with-Full-Data-Alignment
A Streamlit app that fully syncs a Base file with a Source file by replacing FCST for matching LOC+ITEM+CHANNEL+FDATE keys, removing rows missing in Source, and adding new rows from Source. It preserves formatting and outputs a clean pipe-delimited synced file.
